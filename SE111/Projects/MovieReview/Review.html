            <p class="reviewText">I gave the <em>The Simpsons Movie</em> a 4 out of 5 only because of the comedy. The first like half of the movie had me gasping for air from laughing, but after they leave Springfield there is a drop. They become more serious, more focused on trying to make it back home. There was the seen with the old woman in the sky telling homer where to go with her boobs after his family leaves him that was so random it was funny.</p>
            <p class="reviewText">The ending of the movie was my favort, the whole seen of Homer and Bart on the back of the motorcycle driving on the side of the dome with a bomb was really suspenseful, especially when the bomb was bouncing around the opening of the dome, almost falling back in.</p>

                    <li class="TraviaTest">The script for the voice work was to be kept so secret that the producers personally shredded the script after every voicing session</li>
                    <li class="TraviaTest">In the original script, Marge was going to have the vision in church. However, it was changed when the crew felt it would make more sense for the family to be ignoring Grandpa than Marge.</li>
                    <li class="TraviaTest">Edward Norton originally recorded the part of the man who gets crushed by the dome using a Woody Allen impression, but the crew felt the voice was too distracting, so Dan Castellaneta re-recorded the dialogue with a different voice.</li>
