    <p style="width: 300px">My name is <strong>David punchak</strong>. I am 19 years old, my birthday is <i>december 21, 2004</i>. I live at home with my family. I live with my mom, dad, and brother. Hopefully i can find my own place. My brothers name is <i>Josh</i> and he is 17. We also have 2 cats that i love so much. <u>There names are Casper and Piper.</u> It was my idea to get the cats so i have full responsbilty over them. I enjoy taking care of them. I dont have much computer programing experance, i took a class in the 8th grade and another class in 12 grade. A lot of the information that we are learning is all new to me and i hope i can be able to learn it as fast as other people. I have enjoyed coding in my 8th and 12th grade classes, i really like the hardware more than the software but i know you need both. I hope one day i can have my own <em>computer repair store</em>, or somthing like that. </p>
